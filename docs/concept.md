# Conceptual Foundation: Why Holographic?

## 1. The Problem with Tensors & Weights
Deep Learning models store knowledge in synaptic weights ($W$). This is powerful but opaque.
*   **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Updating $W$ affects all stored knowledge.
*   **Black Box**: We cannot mathematically prove *why* a model outputted a specific token.

## 2. Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)
We adopt **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)** principles.
Information involves algebra on random high-dimensional vectors ($\mathbb{C}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$).

### Operations
*   **Bundle (+)**: Superposition. $M = A + B$. Both $A$ and $B$ can be recalled from $M$.
*   **Bind (*)**: Association. $Z = X * Y$. $X$ and $Y$ are bound together (e.g., Variable-Value).
*   **Permute ($\Pi$)**: Sequence/Order encoding.

## 3. Why Complex Numbers?
We use complex-valued vectors ($\mathbb{C}^d$) specifically for **Phase Information**.
*   **Magnitude**: Represents "Confidence" or "Importance".
*   **Phase**: Represents "Relation" or "Timing".
*   **Interference**: Like optical holography, waves interfere. Constructive interference denotes pattern matching; destructive interference denotes noise.

## 4. "Understanding" as "Resonance"
In this architecture, we define "Understanding" not as "Text Generation", but as **"Resonance with Internal State"**.
When an external input vector aligns with the internal memory vector, energy (resonance) is maximized. This physical-like phenomenon is our ground truth for decision making.
